# Welcome Maps

Welcome Maps is specifically designed as a civic tool to allow newcomers to Toronto to discover the resources that matter the most.

To start, you can click on an intersection. We zoom in to that point to make it more helpful! <img src="images/click_to_see_intersection.png" alt="click int" class="inline"/>

If you want, you can also save your intersection. <img src="images/save_the_intersection.png" alt="save int" class="inline"/>

You can also search for intersections, if you already know the name! <img src="images/search_for_an_intersection.png" alt="search int" class="inline"/>

Our autocomplete makes searching for roads and intersections even faster! <img src="images/use_autocomplete_to_save_time.png" alt="autocomp" class="inline"/>

Furthermore, you can see Points of interest, such as hospitals, schools, police stations and community centers.
